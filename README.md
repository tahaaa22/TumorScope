# TumorScope
Is a comprehensive tool for medical image analysis focusing on tumor detection and segmentation. It segments tumors from medical images, compresses the detected region into the DICOM format, and allows efficient decompression for further analysis. The project aims to streamline medical imaging workflows, ensuring accurate detection while optimizing storage and transmission of critical data.

# Key Features:

*Tumor Segmentation:* Accurate detection and segmentation of tumors from grayscale medical images.

*DICOM Compression:* Efficiently compresses segmented images into the DICOM standard, preserving metadata and diagnostic quality.

*Decompression Support:* Allows seamless reconstruction and visualization of compressed medical data.

This tool is ideal for radiologists, researchers, and developers working on medical image processing solutions.
